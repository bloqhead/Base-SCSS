# Base SCSS
Base SCSS is exactly that&mdash;a base Sass file that I use often to build my projects. I found that with libraries like [Bourbon][bourbon] and [Compass][compass], there were a lot of things I didn't use that often. Base SCSS contains mixins and helpers that are super useful and can be coupled with additional Sass libraries if desired.

This simple reference file contains some mixins that are modeled after those available in the aforementioned libraries, as well as some that I've written myself.
