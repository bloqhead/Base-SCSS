# Base SCSS

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/bloqhead/Base-SCSS.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
I've rebuilt Base SCSS to work as a simple, minimalist companion to existing tools like [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io). It's not made to replace the aforementioned tools. It just offers an additional set of things I've written for use on real world projects.

## Install with Bower
Now you can install it via [Bower](http://bower.io)! Navigate to your project in your favorite command line tool and run:

`bower install base-scss`
